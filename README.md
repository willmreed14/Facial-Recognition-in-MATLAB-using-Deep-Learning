- [Full Project Report](https://github.com/willmreed14/Facial-Recognition-in-MATLAB-using-Deep-Learning/blob/main/Reed_Final_Report_PDF.pdf)

## How to Use
1. Download and unzip the project folder either from this repo or from the canvas submission.
2. Open 'Reed_Facial_Recognition.mlx' in MATLAB.
3. Ensure the MATLAB Deep Learning Toolbox is installed on your machine.
4. Ensure the working directory in MATLAB is set to the (unzipped) project folder 'CAP4401-Final-Project-main'.
5. Run the Live Script. The dataset is already properly organized for use within the project folder for your convenience!
